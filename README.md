# Vehicle-routing-system
This repository contains the implementation of a Vehicle Routing System (VRS) designed to optimize routes for vehicles based on two distinct approaches: Shortest Distance and Shortest Time. The system is developed to efficiently plan routes for vehicles, taking into account the geographical distance and real-time traffic conditions.
