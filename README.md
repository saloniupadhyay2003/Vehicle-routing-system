# Vehicle Routing System

This repository contains a Vehicle Routing System (VRS) that optimizes routes for vehicles using two approaches: Shortest Distance and Shortest Time (considering traffic and distance).

## Features

- **Shortest Distance Routing:**
  - Utilizes algorithms to calculate the shortest path based on geographical distance.
  - Ideal for scenarios prioritizing physical distance minimization.

- **Shortest Time Routing:**
  - Incorporates real-time traffic data to calculate time-efficient routes.
  - Adapts dynamically to changing traffic conditions.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SajalSatsangi/<your-repo-name>.git
   cd <your-repo-name>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure API Keys:**
   - Obtain API keys for mapping services and real-time traffic data providers.
   - Add the keys to the configuration file (e.g., `config.yaml`).

4. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
